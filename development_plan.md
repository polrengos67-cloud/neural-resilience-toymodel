## Development Plan

Here are ten potential improvements to enhance the Neural Resilience Toy Model:

1. **Enhanced Visualization:**
   - Implement interactive plots using Plotly for better analysis.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Use parallel processing to speed up dynamics simulations for large networks.

3. **Additional Metrics:**
   - Introduce new resilience metrics such as robustness and vulnerability analysis.

4. **Parameter Tuning:**
   - Implement automatic parameter optimization using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.

5. **Extended Dynamics:**
   - Incorporate more complex dynamics, such as adaptive networks or multi-state models.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier configuration and execution of experiments.

7. **Data Export:**
   - Enable exporting results in various formats like CSV, JSON, and PDF for sharing and further analysis.

8. **Case Studies:**
   - Add notebooks with real-world case studies to demonstrate practical applications.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Improve documentation and provide detailed tutorials on model usage and customization.

10. **Integration with Other Tools:**
    - Connect the model with other simulation tools and platforms, such as Agent-Based Modeling frameworks.
